Purpose:
This package has two main pieces:

1. A Matlab analysis script that calculates and documents metrics of cell motility, including a range of chemotactic indices designed to quantify the presence of reverse migration. This package provides the option to track cells directly in Matlab, or to calculate metrics after tracking with Imaris' spots function.
2. An R markdown script that performs statistical analysis and basic plotting functions to visualize larger datasets in the form of superplot boxplots. The statistical analysis reports the effect size and devises a linear mixed effects model to describe fixed and static effects.

Use: See detailed documentation files for parameters and required user inputs.

Example: This repository contains a detailed analysis for an Arpc1b KO PLB and iPSC model to document lower cell velocity and a unique pausing phenotype.
